# Anonymous reviews: honest feedback without fear of retaliation

## The problem

Leaving an honest negative review can have real-world consequences. The current review ecosystem ties your identity to your feedback, creating a power imbalance where businesses can retaliate against critics.

This isn't theoretical. It happens constantly:

- **Direct harassment**: A customer leaves a bad review on Google Maps. The business owner sees their full name, finds them on social media, and begins a harassment campaign. Some business owners show up in person.
- **Legal intimidation**: Businesses send cease-and-desist letters or threaten defamation lawsuits against reviewers. Even frivolous suits cost thousands to defend.
- **Review removal pressure**: Businesses contact reviewers directly, alternating between offering compensation and making threats, until the review is modified or removed.
- **Social pressure in small communities**: In tight-knit neighborhoods or small towns, leaving a bad review for a local business can create real social fallout. Everyone knows everyone.
- **Professional retaliation**: Reviewing a doctor, lawyer, landlord, or employer can trigger professional consequences when your identity is attached.

## What people actually do today

People have developed workarounds, all of which are hacky and fragile:

- **Burner Gmail accounts**: Creating anonymous email addresses specifically for leaving reviews. Common enough that most people know someone who does this.
- **Simply not reviewing**: The most common response. Bad experiences go unreported. The business continues harming customers. This is the silent majority -- the reviews that were never written.
- **Vague reviews**: Writing reviews so generic they can't be traced back to a specific interaction. "Bad service" instead of the detailed account that would actually help others.
- **Delayed reviews**: Waiting months to leave a review, hoping the business won't connect it to a specific visit. By then, the details have faded and the review is less useful.
- **Telling friends instead**: The honest, detailed review goes into the group chat. The public review either doesn't exist or is watered down.

## Why this matters beyond individual comfort

Anonymous reviews aren't just about protecting thin-skinned complainers. The retaliation problem has structural consequences:

- **Survivorship bias in reviews**: If only people who had good experiences (or who don't fear retaliation) leave reviews, the public record is systematically skewed positive.
- **Bad actors are protected**: The rug store that harasses reviewers keeps its 4.5-star rating. The restaurant that threatens legal action maintains its reputation. Retaliation is a business strategy.
- **Vulnerable populations silenced**: Renters reviewing landlords, patients reviewing doctors, employees reviewing workplaces -- these are the reviews with the biggest power imbalance and the highest retaliation risk.
- **Small business accountability**: Local businesses with loyal customer bases can weaponize their community against critics. The cost of honesty is social ostracism.

## The paradox: anonymity vs. trust

Here's the core tension: fully anonymous reviews are the ones most easily faked. The reason Google ties reviews to accounts is to create some barrier against fabrication. Remove identity entirely and you get 4chan-style chaos.

The breakthrough insight is that you can have **both**:

- **Anonymous to the business and the public**: The rug store owner cannot determine who left the review. No name, no email, no trail.
- **Verified within a trust network**: People in your social graph can cryptographically confirm the review came from a real person within N degrees of connection -- without knowing exactly who.
- **Optionally verified as a real customer**: If the reviewer chooses, they can include proof that they actually transacted with the business, without revealing which specific transaction.

This is the key unlock. You're not anonymous to everyone -- you're anonymous to the people who might retaliate, while remaining credible to the people who need to trust the review.

## The ideal experience

You had a terrible experience at a local business. Today, you either swallow it or risk retaliation. Instead:

- You write your honest, detailed review. You include specifics that help others.
- The review is published. It's visible to people in your trust network (and their connections).
- The business can see the review exists. They can see it came from a verified member of the community. They can see proof it came from an actual customer. But they cannot identify you.
- Your friends see the review and know it came from someone in their trusted circle. They factor it into their decisions.
- If the business disputes the review, they can challenge the proof-of-purchase claim, but they still can't unmask you.
- Six months later, the business has cleaned up its act. Or it hasn't, and the reviews reflect that.

## Who this serves

- Anyone who has been harassed or threatened for leaving an honest review
- Renters reviewing landlords (extreme power imbalance)
- Patients reviewing healthcare providers (HIPAA concerns cut both ways)
- Employees reviewing workplaces (career risk)
- Customers of small/local businesses in tight communities
- Anyone in a culture or community where public criticism carries social punishment
- People who simply want to be honest without thinking about consequences
